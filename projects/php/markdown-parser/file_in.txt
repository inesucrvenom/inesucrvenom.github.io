# Broccoli
Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowerhead is
eaten as a vegetable.

## Etymology
The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means "the
flowering crest of a cabbage", and is the diminutive form of brocco, meaning "small
nail" or "sprout". Broccoli is often boiled or steamed but may be eaten raw.
