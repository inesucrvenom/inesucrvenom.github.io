<h1>Broccoli</h1>
<p>Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowerhead is
eaten as a vegetable.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means "the
flowering crest of a cabbage", and is the diminutive form of brocco, meaning "small
nail" or "sprout". Broccoli is often boiled or steamed but may be eaten raw.</p>
