Made sometime in 2009.

Daily database dumps were loaded into local MySQL with cronjob, then this php used local DB to analyse whatever I wanted to see - mainly goal was to see which players are inactive for several days in a row so that you can safely farm them without retribution.

Made my own since commonly used one didn't include my server from its beginning, and time is of the essence here :wink:
