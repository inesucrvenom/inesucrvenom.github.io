Collection of projects that I've done outside of the workplace: for practice, for interviews, for fun, when I wanted a script to do something faster (and then spend significantly more time on making the script work), you know, the usual :grin:

Approximate date is retroactively assigned to the projects in order to illustrate the whole journey.
