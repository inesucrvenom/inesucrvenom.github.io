This is some *italic text*

- list

This is `someJavaScript()`.

And this is with three ``` in line code ```.


Language is normally auto-detected,
but it can also be specified:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
DELETE FROM sessions;
```

no language marked
```
SELECT * FROM users;
DELETE FROM sessions;
```


Indent with a tab or 4 spaces
for unformatted text.

    This text will not be formatted:
    Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--

This is detected as a link:
https://joplinapp.org

And this is a link anchoring text content:
[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org)

And this is a link, with a title,
anchoring text content:
[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org "Joplin project page")

# math
To add an inline equation, wrap the expression in $, eg. $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$. To create an expression block, wrap it as follow:
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
	\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
	\,d\xi
$$

# footnote

Simples inline footnote ^[I'm inline!]

# toc
Any of ${toc}, [[toc]], [toc], [[_toc_]]
Adds a table of contents to the location of the toc page. Based on headings and sub-headings

# sub and sup
X~1~
x^2^

# deflist

Term 1

:   Definition 1

Term 2 with *inline markup*

:   Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

    Third paragraph of definition 2.

Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally be followed by a blank line, and must be followed by one or more definitions. A definition begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one or two spaces.

A term may have multiple definitions, and each definition may consist of one or more block elements (paragraph, code block, list, etc.), each indented four spaces or one tab stop. The body of the definition (including the first line, aside from the colon or tilde) should be indented four spaces. However, as with other Markdown lists, you can “lazily” omit indentation except at the beginning of a paragraph or other block element:

Term 1

:   Definition
with lazy continuation.

    Second paragraph of the definition.
If you leave space before the definition (as in the example above), the text of the definition will be treated as a paragraph. In some output formats, this will mean greater spacing between term/definition pairs. For a more compact definition list, omit the space before the definition:

Term 1
  ~ Definition 1

Term 2
  ~ Definition 2a
  ~ Definition 2b
Note that space between items in a definition list is required.
