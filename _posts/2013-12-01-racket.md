Programs from a course I've taken, where I've learned how to design programs in top down way, using test driven development and wishes until the very bottom which when implemented, made whole thing - work.

[How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2020-5-6/Book/index.html) is the base for the course I've made this programs for.

First task was to complete given design for a simple text editor.
Main goal was to understand compound data and be able to design functions for it.

Second was to render a portfolio.
Main goal here was to understand arbitrary sized data, and learn to use the recipes for referential data.

Final one was the 4 queen problem.
Main goal was to use all recipes needed, with special emphasis on generative recursions.

My big takeaways from the course were - a code is meant for other people to read, and properly done TDD with focus on breaking a problem into the smaller pieces will really pay off at the end.
