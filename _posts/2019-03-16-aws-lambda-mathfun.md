title: "Few simple functions done with AWS Lambda"
---
Learning project to grasp some new topics (serverless development, automatic deployment); while improving others (testing, handling errors and exceptions, general Python skills).
**â˜… Technologies: Python (boto3, json, unittest), AWS Lambda, Ansible**

Available on [github](https://github.com/inesucrvenom/mathfun)

Especially tricky was to figure out how to do automatic deployment for all lambda functions with only one command and not uploading through the browser one by one.

Another tricky one was how to automatically reuse / parameterise unit tests for testing results of different implementations of the same mathematical function.
