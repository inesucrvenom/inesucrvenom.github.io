Simplified Markdown parser, geolocation something and blog done with php.

## Markdown parser
```
The task is to create a parser that takes a given input and converts it to some output using some of the standard MarkDown components and some special flavor.

It has the following components:
* The paragraph behaviour is the same as in the normal MarkDown
* [linked text](URL) that will be converted to <a href="URL">linked text</a>
* # Some text that will be converted to <h1>Some text</h1>
* ## Some text #2 that will be converted to <h2>Some text #2</h2>
* ___EAT___ that will be converted to <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Broccoli_and_cross_section_edit.jpg/320px-Broccoli_and_cross_section_edit.jpg" title="Broccoli is yummy!" alt="A lovely picture of broccoli" />
```

Solution is [here](/projects/php/markdown-parser), which includes the example input and output file.
